This is a simple timer written in MicroPython

It is coded for the D1 Mini and a ssd1306 display at 128x64.
One of the functions is for drawing a 7 segment style number font that is bigger and more readable than the original mpy font. It is fairly portable.
Porting to other MCUs that support micropy should be very simple.
