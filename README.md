This is a simple timer written in MicroPython

It is coded for the D1 Mini and a ssd1306 display at 128x64.

Letters.py contains a function for drawing 7 and 14 segment style fonts that are bigger and more readable than the original mpy font. It is fairly portable.

Porting to other MCUs that support micropy should be very simple.
